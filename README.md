# Startup Success Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict the success of startups based on various features using machine learning techniques. It explores the factors influencing startup success and builds a predictive model to assist venture capitalists (VCs) in funding decisions.

## Problem Statement
Startups require significant funding to grow in a competitive ecosystem. This project helps VCs by analyzing the factors that contribute to startup success and provides a predictive model to forecast outcomes effectively.

## Objectives
- Analyze startup data to identify key success factors.
- Develop a machine learning model to predict startup success.

## Dataset
The dataset contains variables that describe startup performance, characteristics, and outcomes. 
Data exploration steps include:
- Cleaning missing or inconsistent values.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.

## Libraries Used
The project utilizes the following Python libraries:
- Data Manipulation: pandas, numpy
- Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Statistics: scipy
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn

## Workflow
1. Data Exploration
   - Import and clean data.
   - Perform descriptive statistics and visualization.
   - Analyze feature distributions and correlations.
2. Feature Engineering
   - Handle missing values.
   - Transform and encode categorical variables.
3. Modeling
   - Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees).
   - Evaluate performance using metrics like Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
   - Optimize hyperparameters.
4. Results
   - Present findings with precision-recall curves and other visualizations.

## Key Insights
- Detailed insights into startup success factors.
- Identification of the most impactful variables.

## Usage
### Requirements
Install the required Python libraries using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Project
Execute the notebook step-by-step to:
- Explore the data.
- Build and evaluate the predictive model.

## Results
The final model achieved a precision-recall score of 94%, indicating its effectiveness in predicting startup success.
